    "* __Statistic__: Any summary number that describes the sample (e.g. sample mean).\n",
    "* __Confidence Interval__: The interval that we have confidence that contains a population parameter.\n",
    "* __Hypothesis__: Assumption about a sample of population.\n",
    "* __Contingency Table__: Summarize the frequency of two categorical variable in a $r \\times c$ table, where $r$ and $c$ are the total levels of the categorical variable respectively.\n",

    "## __Hypothesis testing__\n",
    "* General Procedures:\n",
    "    * Step 1: Making an initial assumption.\n",
    "    * Step 2: Collecting evidence (data).\n",
    "    * Step 3: Based on the available evidence (data), deciding whether to reject or not reject the initial assumption.\n",
    "* Critical Value Approach:\n",
    "    * __Pinciple__ : The critical value approach involves determining \"likely\" or \"unlikely\" by determining whether or not the observed test statistic is more extreme than would be expected if the null hypothesis were true. That is, it entails comparing the observed test statistic to some cutoff value, called the \"critical value.\" If the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the test statistic is not as extreme as the critical value, then the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n",
    "    * Example on testing population mean $\\mu$:\n",
    "        1. Specify the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "        2. Using the sample data and assuming the null hypothesis is true, calculate the value of the test statistic. To conduct the hypothesis test for the population mean $\\mu$, we use the t-statistic $t^* = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}}$  which follows a t-distribution with n - 1 degrees of freedom.\n",
    "        3. Determine the critical value by finding the value of the known distribution of the test statistic such that the probability of making a Type I error — which is denoted  (greek letter \"alpha\") and is called the \"significance level of the test\" — is small (typically 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10).\n",
    "        4. Compare the test statistic to the critical value. If the test statistic is more extreme in the direction of the alternative than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the test statistic is less extreme than the critical value, do not reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "* P-Value Approach:\n",
    "    * __Principle__: The P-value approach involves determining \"likely\" or \"unlikely\" by determining the probability — assuming the null hypothesis were true — of observing a more extreme test statistic in the direction of the alternative hypothesis than the one observed. If the P-value is small, say less than (or equal to) , then it is \"unlikely.\" And, if the P-value is large, say more than , then it is \"likely.\"\n",

    "        3. Using the known distribution of the test statistic, calculate the P-value: \"If the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability that we'd observe a more extreme test statistic in the direction of the alternative hypothesis than we did?\" \n",
    "        4. Set the significance level, , the probability of making a Type I error to be small — 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10. Compare the P-value to . If the P-value is less than (or equal to) , reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the P-value is greater than , do not reject the null hypothesis.\n",
