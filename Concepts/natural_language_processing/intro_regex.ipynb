    "## What is regular expression?\n",
    "Regular expression (short for _regex_) is a language for specifying text search strings. It is particularly useful for searching in texts when we have a _pattern_ to search for and a _corpus_ of texts to search through."

    "Regular expressions are case sensitive.\n",
    "* `[]`: The string of characters inside the braces specifies a __disjunction__ of characters to match\n",
    "* `[]` + `-`: Specify any one character in a __range__\n",
    "* `[^]`: Negate the pattern \n",
    "* `?`: zero or one occurrence of the previous char or expression\n",
    "* `*`: _kleene *_, zero or more occurrences, greedy matching (always match the largest string they can)\n",
    "* `*?`: _kleene *_, zero or more occurences, non-greedy matching (match as little text as possible)\n",
    "* `+`: _kleene +_, one or more occurrences, greedy matching (always match the largest string they can)\n",
    "* `+?`: _kleene +_, one or more occurrences, non-greedy matching (match as little text as possible)\n",
    "* `.`: wildcard expression that matches any single character\n",
    "* `^`: start of line\n",
    "* `$`: end of line\n",
    "* `\\b`: word boundary\n",
    "* `\\B`: non-word boundary\n",
    "* `\\d`: `[0-9]`, any digit\n",
    "* `\\D`: `[^0-9]`, any non-digit\n",
    "* `\\w`: `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`, any alphanumeric/underscore\n",
    "* `\\W`: `[^\\w]`, a non-alphanumeric\n",
    "* `\\s`: `[ \\r\\t\\n\\f]`, whitespace(space, tab)\n",
    "* `\\S`: `[^\\s]`, Non-whitespace`\n",
    "* `{n}`: exactly n occurrences of the previous char or expression\n",
    "* `{n,m}`: from n to m occurrences of the previous char or expression\n",
    "* `{n,}`: at least n occurrences of the previous char or expression\n",
    "* `{,m}`: up to m occurrences of the previous char or expression\n",
    "* `\\*`: an asterisk “*”\n",
    "* `\\.`: a period “.”\n",
    "* `\\?`: a question mark\n",
    "* `\\n`: a new line\n",
    "* `\\t`: a tab\n",
