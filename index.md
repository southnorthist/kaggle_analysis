## Welcome to My GitHub Page

This page gives an overview of the projects that I am working on. Specifically on problems that interest me using different machine learning techniques and visualization tools.


### Machine Learning in Action

* Credit-ability Classification using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and XGBoost - _wip_
  * Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost

* Using Movie Lens Data for Market Basket Analysis and Recommender Systems- _tba_
  * Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, MLxtend
  
* Credit Card User Segmentation with Clustering - _v1_
  * Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
  
* US Real GDP and Personal Income by States Visualization - _v1_
  * Python: Request for API data extraction, Tableau public
  


### Statistics and Machine Learning Concepts Made Easy
I'm summarizing the basic statistics concepts and machine learning methodologies using jupyter notebooks which including:

* Basic Statistical Concepts _wip_
 * Hypothesis Testing
 * Power Analysis
 * Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall, ROC curve
* Simple Linear Regression _tba_
* Basic Classification Methods - _v1_
* Tree-based Methods (Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting)  - _v1_
* XGBoost - _v1_
* Clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) - _v1_

### Data Science Toolkit and Tech Stack
I'm also building utility functions to help preprocessing, visualizing data and tuning machine learning models.
In addition, I summarize and share useful tips on SQL and MLOPs after self-learning in here: https://southwest-qh.github.io/
