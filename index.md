## Welcome to My GitHub Page

This page gives an overview of the projects that I am working on. Specifically on problems that interest me using different machine learning techniques and visualization tools.


### Machine Learning in Action

### Statistics and Machine Learning Concepts Made Easy
I'm summarizing the basic statistics concepts and machine learning methodologies using jupyter notebooks which including:

* Basic Statistical Concepts - _wip_
 * Hypothesis Testing
 * Power Analysis
 * Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall, ROC curve
* Simple Linear Regression - _tba_
* Basic Classification Methods - [_latest version_](https://github.com/southwest-qh/Data_Science_Playground/blob/master/Concepts/ml_methods/Basic_classification_Methods.ipynb) 
* Tree-based Methods (Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting)  - [_latest version_](https://github.com/southwest-qh/Data_Science_Playground/blob/master/Concepts/ml_methods/Tree_Based_Methods.ipynb)
* XGBoost - [_latest version_](https://github.com/southwest-qh/Data_Science_Playground/blob/master/Concepts/ml_methods/XGBoost.ipynb)
* Clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) - [_latest version_](https://github.com/southwest-qh/Data_Science_Playground/blob/master/Concepts/ml_methods/clustering.ipynb)

### Data Science Toolkit and Tech Stack
I'm also building utility functions to help preprocessing, visualizing data and tuning machine learning models.
In addition, I summarize and share useful tips on SQL and MLOPs after self-learning in [here](https://southwest-qh.github.io/).
