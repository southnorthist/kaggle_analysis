## Welcome to My GitHub Page

This page gives an overview of the projects that I have been working. Particularliy on problems that interests me using machine learning techniques and visualization tools.


### Machine Learning in Action

* Credit-ability Classification using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and XGBoost - _wip_
  * Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
  
* Credit Card User Clustering - _v1_
  * Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
  
* US Real GDP and Personal Income by States and Industry  Visualization - _v1_
  * Python: Request for API data extraction, Tableau public
  
* Movie Lens Data Market Basket Analysis - _wip_
  * Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, MLxtend
  


### Statistics and Machine Learning Concepts Made Easy
I'm summarizing the basic statistics concepts and machine learning methodologies using jupyter notebooks which including:

* Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall, ROC curve
* Simple Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression - _wip_
* Tree-based Method - _wip_
* XGBoost - _v1_
* Clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) - _v1_

### Data Science Toolkit
I'm also building some utility functions to help preprocessing and visualizing to facilitate machine learning model build.
