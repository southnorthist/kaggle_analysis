## Welcome to My GitHub Page

This page gives an overview of the projects that I have been working. Particularliy on problems that interests me using machine learning techniques and visualization tools.


### Machine Learning in Action

* Creditability Classification using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and XGBoost
  * Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
  
* Credit Card User Clustering 
  * Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
  
* Movie Lens Data Market Basket Analysis

### Statistics and Machine Learning Concepts Made Easy
I'm summarizing the basic statistics concepts and machine learning methodologies in jupyter notebooks in plain language.

* Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall, ROC curve
* Simple Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Tree-based Method
* XGBoost
* Clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN)
*
### Data Science Toolkit
I'm also building some utility functions to help preprocessing and visualizing to facilitate machine learning model build.
