# Credit-ability Classification Analysis using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and XGBoost

In the credit risk modeling world, the typical problem is to determine whether a client is creditworthy enough to lend money to. As can be easily determined this is a typical binary classification problem. A lot of the time banks or credit score companies will take a step further on the classification problem to give clients "credit scores" which can better segment clients for marketing campaigns, risk monitoring, etc.

This project aims to use the publicly available dataset and commonly used techniques to illustrate the creditworthiness classification problem.
