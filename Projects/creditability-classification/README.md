# Credit-ability Classification Analysis using Logistic Regression, Descision Trees, Random Forests and XGBoost

In the credit risk modeling world, the typical problem is to determine whether a client is credit worthy enough to lend money to. As can be easily determined that this is a typical binary classification problem. A lot of the times banks or credit score companies will take a step further on the classification problem to give clients "credit scores" which can better segment clients for marketing campaigns, risk monitoring, etc.

This project aims to use the public available dataset and commonly used techniques to illustrate the credit worthiness classification problem.
