# XGBoost in a nutshell - Theory and Application
This folder will contain:
* A notebook that explains the theory of XGBoost and also applications of the method with real data example.
* We also aim to build a class that integrate the XGBoost model building pipeline given pre-processed clean dataset. 

Ideally, through iterative improvement, it will become part of our Data Science Toolkit that can be readily usable given
any problem.
