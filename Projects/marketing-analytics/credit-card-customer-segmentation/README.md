# Credit Card Customer Clustering

This project uses the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata) to develop a marketing strategy for credit card users. The dataset contains usage behavior (in total 18 usage behavior variables) of the around 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months.

The notebook will follow the steps below to help segmenting customers:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Pre-processing for Analysis
3. Clustering and Visualization
4. Interpretation and Recommendation
