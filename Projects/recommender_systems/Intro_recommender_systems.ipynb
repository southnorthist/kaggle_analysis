    "## 1. What are recommender systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are been used very widely these days in the world in simple ways or more sophisticated ways:\n",
    "* Your best friend recommended one restaruant to you because one of his friends recommended him this restaurant.\n",
    "* Youtube recommends the videos you may like from your watching history\n",
    "* Amazon recommends products based on your purchasing history or other people's choices who has similar purchasing behavior or preferences as you.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are introducing the recommender systems used in the digital world. It is classified in three types: _Simple popularity-based Recommenders_, _Content-based recommenders_, _Collaborative filtering engines_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Simple popularity-based Recommenders\n",
    "It offers a general recommendation to every user based on the popularity. It can be further grouped into genre, district, etc. For movies recommending system, IMDB Top 250 is an example.\n",
    "* _Algorithm_: \n",
    "    * Calculate the number of votes for each item.\n",
    "    * Rank the items by their number votes.\n",
    "    * Select the top $k$ items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* _Limitations_: No customization for different users. All users get the same recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Content-based recommenders\n",
    "It recommends similar items based on a particular characteristics of a item. The system utilizes the metadata of an item to make recommendations, for example, genre, director, description, actors, for movies. The assumption behind it is that if a user likes an item, then he/she will like similar items. Youtube is an example for this type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Algorithm_:\n",
    "    * Prepare the dataset for items, a lot of times using one-hot encoding for categorical features. e.g movies with genre, director, actors.\n",
    "    * Find the similarity between each item. We can choose different similarity metrics.\n",
    "    * Rank the similarity score from highest to lowest and select top $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Limitations_: The recommendations are based on past experience of users. \n",
    "    * It will not recommend new areas the user has not experienced before. \n",
    "    * Even different users have different preference, if they have same past experience, the recommender will not differentiate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Collaborative filtering engines\n",
    "It predicts the rating or preference of an item based on past ratings and preferences from other users.\n",
    "* _User_based Filtering_: If a similar users like the item, the system will recommend the item to the user.\n",
    "* _Item_based Filtering_: The system finds similar items based on how people have rated it in the past and if a user like one item, it will recommend the other one that is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.1 User-Item Interaction Matrix\n",
    "One of the important data used in the _collaborative filtering engines_ is User-Item Interaction Matrix, where each cell is either __explicit__ or __implicit__ rating from the user to the item:\n",
    "    * __explicit__ rating: Scores that users explicitly give to the item.\n",
    "    * __implicit__ rating: Scores that derived from user behavior, e.g., number of time user is using/watching the item.\n",
    "    * The matrix normally is very sparse since users cannot interactive with every items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "|User/Item|Item 1| Item 2 | Item ... | Item M|\n",
    "|:--      |:--   |:--     |:--       |:--    |\n",
    "|User 1   | 2    | 4      |          | 3     |\n",
    "|User 2   |      | 3      |          | 1     |\n",
    "|User ... | 1    |        | 4        |       |\n",
    "|User N   | 5    |        |          | 2     |\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Limitations_: We need prior information about the user or the item before we can derive the similarity between the user and other users or between the item and other items.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.2 Similarity Score Based Recommenders\n",
    "Based on the User-Item Interaction Matrix, we can caluate the similarity score (metrics can be pearson correlation or consine correlation) between items or users. We use the user review as the measures to calculate the similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _User_based Filtering_: \n",
    "    * For a particular user, find a group of similar users (can use the metrics threshold to determine the group size).\n",
    "    * Calculate the average rating of each item from the group of similar users.\n",
    "    * Rank the items based on the average rating from highest to lowest and select the top $k$ that they have not interacted before.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Item_based Filtering_: \n",
    "    * For a particular item that a user liked, based on the similarity metric, rank the other items from highest to lowest.\n",
    "    * Select the top $k$ items that the user has not interacted before.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.3 Model Based Recommenders\n",
    "A lot of times, there are some latent factors that motivates users to give such one rating. One of the techniques is to find these latent factors by decompose the user-item interaction matrix and then use latent features to infer the ratings the users might give for a product they have never interacted with before.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods for matrix decomposition:\n",
    "* Factor Analysis\n",
    "* PCA\n",
    "* Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)\n",
    "* Truncated SVD"
